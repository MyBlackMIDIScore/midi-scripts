# midi-scripts

In this repository you will find certain MIDI modification scripts that I created for personal use.

You can use them as you wish, following the license.

More information can be found in the READMEs inside each script's folder.

## Scripts

- `merge-to-single-track` (Merges all notes of a MIDI to a single track)
- `multi-channel-tracks-remover` (Will split the notes from a MIDI will multi-channel tracks)
